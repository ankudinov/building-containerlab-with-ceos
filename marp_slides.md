# Agenda

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right](img/pexels-suzy-hazelwood-1226398.jpg)

- Setup Docker on the host
- Install Containerlab and import cEOS-lab image
- Clone this repository and deploy the lab
- Inspect and destroy the lab
- Deploy the lab with a custom startup config
- Make a packet capture
- cLab in a Container
- Possible caveats

> This workshop is a step-by-step guide explaining how to build a lab environment with [Containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/) and Arista cEOS-lab. It is  focusing on essential and cEOS-lab specific features. Please check [Containerlab documentation](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/) for details.

---

# Prerequisites

- This workshop requires:
  - Ubuntu LTS 22.04 or later
  - 8 GB RAM and 4 vCPUs
- Only x86 architecture is supported. It is technically possible to [run Container lab on ARM](https://containerlab.dev/install/#containerlab-on-arm-based-macs), but there are no network images available for ARM as of Aug 2023.
- You can use [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [VSCode devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for this workshop. The detailed procedure is described in the appendix.
- The appendix also provides instructions for creating a KVM VM with Ubuntu Cloud Image.
- There is also Vagrant file available in this repository. Use it at your own risk.

# Setup Docker on the Host

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

<div class="columns">
<div>

> Check if Docker is already installed. In this case you can skip the steps below.

1. Install Docker on the host. The detailed instructions are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). You can used one-liner script for that.
2. Add your user to the `docker` group.
3. Logout and login again to apply the changes.
4. Check the Docker version and run `hello-world` container to test functionality.

</div>
<div>

```bash
# install Docker
sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
# add user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
# test docker
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

</div>
</div>

---

# Setup Git (Optional)

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

- Git must be pre-installed. Otherwise you are in a wrong place. Escape! ðŸ‘¾ ðŸš€
- Setup your name and email address:

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "<first-and-2nd-name>"
  git config --global user.email "<your-email>"
  ```

- Check the current configuration:

  ```bash
  git config --list
  ```

---

# Download cEOS-lab Image

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

1. Login to [Arista Software Download](https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download) portal. You need to have an account to download the image.
2. Select `EOS > Active Releases > 4.30 > EOS-4.30.2F > cEOS-lab`.
3. Download `cEOS-lab-4.30.2F.tar.xz` image.
4. Upload the image to your lab VM. For example, you can use SFTP to transfer the image:

  ```bash
  sftp ${REMOTE_USER}@${UBUNTU_VM_IP}:/home/${REMOTE_USER}/${IMAGE_DIR} <<< $'put cEOS-lab-4.30.2F.tar*'
  # for example:
  # sftp user@10.10.10.11:/home/user/images <<< $'put cEOS-lab-4.30.2F.tar*'
  ```

> NOTE: if you are using Vagrant, add the image to `.gitignored` directory. It will be automatically copied to the VM.
> If Github Codespace is used and token is set, the image will be pulled from arista.com automatically.

# Import cEOS-lab Image

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

1. Go to the directory with the uploaded image and import the image:

    ```bash
    docker import cEOS-lab-4.30.2F.tar.xz ceos-lab:4.30.2F
    ```

    > NOTE: you can also import the image with the tag latest to allow quick "upgrade" of those lab where specific version is not required: `docker tag ceos-lab:4.30.2F ceos-lab:latest`

2. Confirm that the image was imported successfully:

    ```console
    $ docker image ls
    REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    ceos-lab      4.30.2F   21b540a4a343   45 minutes ago   1.95GB
    ceos-lab      latest    21b540a4a343   45 minutes ago   1.95GB
    hello-world   latest    b038788ddb22   3 months ago     9.14kB
    ```

---

# Install Containerlab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- It's just a one-liner:
  
  ```bash
  bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.containerlab.dev)"
  ```

- Refer to the [Containerlab quick start documentation](https://containerlab.dev/quickstart/) for the details.

---

# Deploy The Lab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/lab_setup.png)

- Inspect `default_cfg.clab.yml` and deploy the lab:

  ```bash
  sudo containerlab deploy --debug --topo default_cfg.clab.yml
  ```

- This command will deploy Containerlab with the default EOS configuration provided by Containerlab. The `--debug` flag is optional, but provides additional information while Containerlab is starting.

  > NOTE: If there is a single `.clab.yml` file in the current directory, it is possible to use `sudo containerlab deploy` command without specifying the topology file. As we have multiple files in the directory, we must specify the topology explicitly.

---

# Inspect the Lab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 12px;}</style>

Once the lab is ready, you'll see a table with the list of deployed containers, their host names and management IPs:

```text
+---+----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------+---------+--------------------+--------------+
| # |         Name         | Container ID |      Image      | Kind |  State  |    IPv4 Address    | IPv6 Address |
+---+----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------+---------+--------------------+--------------+
| 1 | clab-ceos-lab-a_host | 421665f3e67f | ceos-lab:latest | ceos | running | 192.168.123.100/24 | N/A          |
| 2 | clab-ceos-lab-leaf1  | a7f7c80aa90f | ceos-lab:latest | ceos | running | 192.168.123.21/24  | N/A          |
| 3 | clab-ceos-lab-leaf2  | 142ab91f0ceb | ceos-lab:latest | ceos | running | 192.168.123.22/24  | N/A          |
| 4 | clab-ceos-lab-spine1 | 22464060dcf8 | ceos-lab:latest | ceos | running | 192.168.123.11/24  | N/A          |
| 5 | clab-ceos-lab-spine2 | 3f53d1de7add | ceos-lab:latest | ceos | running | 192.168.123.12/24  | N/A          |
+---+----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------+---------+--------------------+--------------+
```

> You can call the table again any time with `sudo clab inspect -t default_cfg.clab.yml`.

Containerlab creates corresponding entries in the `/etc/hosts` file as well:

```bash
$ cat /etc/hosts | grep -i clab-
###### CLAB-ceos-lab-START ######
192.168.123.22  clab-ceos-lab-leaf2
192.168.123.11  clab-ceos-lab-spine1
192.168.123.12  clab-ceos-lab-spine2
192.168.123.100 clab-ceos-lab-a_host
192.168.123.21  clab-ceos-lab-leaf1
###### CLAB-ceos-lab-END ######
```

You can also list containers using docker command:

```console
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
22464060dcf8   ceos-lab:latest   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes             clab-ceos-lab-spine1
3f53d1de7add   ceos-lab:latest   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes             clab-ceos-lab-spine2
a7f7c80aa90f   ceos-lab:latest   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes             clab-ceos-lab-leaf1
421665f3e67f   ceos-lab:latest   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes             clab-ceos-lab-a_host
142ab91f0ceb   ceos-lab:latest   "bash -c '/mnt/flashâ€¦"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes             clab-ceos-lab-leaf2
```

# Access cEOS-lab CLI

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

There are few options to access cEOS-lab CLI:

- SSH to the container. For ex.:
  
  ```bash
  # the default login is `admin` and password is `admin`
  ssh admin@clab-ceos-lab-leaf1
  ```

- Connect to the "console" using Docker command. For ex.: `docker exec -it clab-ceos-lab-leaf1 Cli`

  > NOTE: `docker exec -it clab-ceos-lab-leaf1 bash` allows to connect directly to the switch shell.

Execute few command to confirm that cEOS-lab is functioning:

- `show version`
- `show lldp neighbors`
- `show running-config`

---

# Destroy the Lab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- Destroy the lab with `sudo containerlab destroy -t default_cfg.clab.yml`  
- This will stop all containers, but will keep the files created by clab for the next run. For example, startup-configs.  
- Check the flash content for leaf1 and inspect it's startup config:

  ```console
  $ ls clab-ceos-lab/leaf1/flash/
  AsuFastPktTransmit.log  SsuRestore.log        aboot  fastpkttx.backup  kickstart-config  schedule        system_mac_address
  Fossil                  SsuRestoreLegacy.log  debug  if-wait.sh        persist           startup-config
  $ cat clab-ceos-lab/leaf1/flash/startup-config
  ```

- To remove these files and have a clean environment on the next run, use `--cleanup` flag:

  ```bash
  sudo containerlab destroy -t default_cfg.clab.yml --cleanup
  ```

---

# Deploy the Lab with Custom Startup Config

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- Deploy the lab with the custom configuration:

  ```bash
  sudo containerlab deploy -t custom_cfg.clab.yml --reconfigure
  ```

  > NOTE: `--reconfigure` is required if `--cleanup` flag was not specified in the previous step. Otherwise custom configs will be ignored and startup configs in `clab-ambassadors_clab/` will be used instead.

- Custom startup configs are located in the `init-configs` directory and assigned to every node using `startup-config:` key in the `custom_cfg.clab.yml`. This allows creating pre-configured labs. In this case pre-configured MLAG between leaf switches and basic BGP underlay configuration. Host should be able to ping loopbacks of all leaf and spine switches. Connect to the host and run following commands to confirm that:

  ```console
  $ ssh admin@clab-ceos-lab-a_host
  Password:
  a_host>en
  a_host#bash for i in {1..4}; do ping -c 4 10.${i}.${i}.${i}; done
  ```

---

# Additional Checks

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

<div class="columns">
<div>

Execute following commands on leaf1 to confirm that it is functioning as expected:

- `show interfaces status`
- `show ip bgp summary`
- `show mlag`
- `show port-channel dense`

> NOTE: `ambassadors_custom_cfg.clab.yml` has custom interface mapping defined in `interface_mapping.json` and assigned to cEOS-lab containers as bind mount. This helps to change default Management0 interface to Management1 as on physical switches.

</div>
<div>

```json
{
    "ManagementIntf": {
        "eth0": "Management1"
    },
    "EthernetIntf": {
        "eth1_1": "Ethernet1/1",
        "eth2_1": "Ethernet2/1",

        "eth4_1": "Ethernet4/1",
        "eth10_1": "Ethernet10/1"
    }
}

# Make Packet Capture

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- Every container has it's own Linux namespace. To list all interfaces for leaf1, execute following command:

  ```bash
  sudo ip netns exec clab-ceos-lab-leaf1 ip link
  ```

- Run following command and wait a few minutes to capture a BGP packets:

  ```bash
  sudo ip netns exec clab-ceos-lab-leaf1 tcpdump -nni eth1_1 port 179 -vvv
  ```

- For additional details about packet capture check [cLab documentation](https://containerlab.dev/manual/wireshark/).

```console

# Containerlab in a Container

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

Destroy the lab with cleanup flag: `sudo containerlab destroy -t ambassadors_custom_cfg.clab.yml --cleanup`

It is possible to run the containerlab on the host without installing it. For that a Docker container with cLab can be executed on a Docker host.  
This can be helpful to run Containerlab on an Intel-based Mac Book or in some special cases.

Test that by running following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
  --pid="host" \
  -w $(pwd) \
  -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
  ghcr.io/srl-labs/clab bash
```

This will start the container with cLab interactively. Once inside the container prompt, execute the following command to start the lab:

```bash
containerlab deploy -t ambassadors_custom_cfg.clab.yml --reconfigure
```

Check the lab and destroy it: `containerlab destroy -t ambassadors_custom_cfg.clab.yml --cleanup`  
Exit the container.

The default `ghcr.io/srl-labs/clab` container is making all changes as root. That can cause permissions issues if you are working with your repository from the container prompt. It is better to use `ghcr.io/srl-labs/clab` as non-interactive or craft your own container to map the user ID correctly.

To use the container in non-interactive way execute following command:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
  --pid="host" \
  -w $(pwd) \
  -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
  ghcr.io/srl-labs/clab containerlab deploy -t ambassadors_custom_cfg.clab.yml --reconfigure
```

To destroy the lab:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
  --pid="host" \
  -w $(pwd) \
  -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
  ghcr.io/srl-labs/clab containerlab destroy -t ambassadors_custom_cfg.clab.yml --cleanup
```

# Building a Custom Container with cLab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

It is possible to build a custom container with Containerlab installed. We are not going to discuss in detail how to build Docker containers, but required `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh` and `gitconfig` are already present in this repository. There is also `updateUID.Dockerfile` that allows to change user id inside the container to match UID of the VM user. That is not required for our lab, but can a critical requirement in certain cases. For example, CentOS is very strict regarding user IDs.

The custom container has following features:

- ZSH and a nice prompt with a whale. =)
- Number of Linux tools pre-installed.
- Docker (in Docker) and Containerlab installed
- Aliases to start and stop the lab and connect to the lab switches
- Entrypoint
- UID and GID inside the container matching UID and GID outside the container
- Ansible included

Let's build our own container now:

```bash
# build a temp container with UID 1000
docker build --rm --pull --no-cache -f Dockerfile -t ambassadors_temp_image .
# build final container with matching UID
docker build -f updateUID.Dockerfile -t ambassadors_clab:latest --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=ambassadors_temp_image --build-arg REMOTE_USER=clab --build-arg NEW_UID=$(id -u) --build-arg NEW_GID=$(id -g) --build-arg IMAGE_USER=clab .
```

Start the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
  --pid="host" \
  -w $(pwd) \
  -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
  ambassadors_clab:latest
```

Test container features:

- start the lab: `lab_start`
- connect to leaf1: `leaf1`
- stop the lab: `lab_stop`

Custom container can be very useful if you have special requirements or want to create an environment with all dependencies pre-installed and minimum actions required from the user to start the lab. Example: [avd-quickstart-containerlab](https://github.com/arista-netdevops-community/avd-quickstart-containerlab)

---

# Ansible with Containerlab

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

When containerlab starts it automatically creates Ansible inventory that can be used to automate certain tasks in the lab.  
Start `ambassadors_clab:latest` container we have created earlier and deploy the lab.  
Inspect the Ansible inventory: `cat clab-ambassadors_clab/ansible-inventory.yml`  
Ansible is already installed inside the container and ansible.cfg is provided in the repository as well as the playbook `check_the_lab.yml`.
Run the playbook by executing command `ansible-playbook playbooks/check_the_lab.yml`  
This playbook will execute number of show commands on all switches in the lab and present output on the screen.

---

# Possible Scale Caveats

> WARNING: If you are planning to deploy a high scale lab, test it on a non-production host that you can access and recover any time. Incorrectly deployed Containerlab at scale can bring your host down due to high CPU utilization on start.

Generally, Ubuntu systems have quite low `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` limit by default. Even if it was increased, older cEOS-lab containers can decrease system limit to 1256. That is not sufficient for a high scale lab. The lab may fail to start and even bring your host down due to high CPU.

In reality increasing inotify limit on a modern host with high RAM will not create any disadvantages. If you are planning to deploy older cEOS-lab container, you can increase it manually.

1st, define your inotify limit. You can safely assume that it will not be more than 1256*number of containers. But the required limit is expected to be significantly below that. Newer cEOS-lab images set the limit to 62800, that is a good number for most cLab deployments.

Set your system limit: `sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=62800`

Create 99-zceos.conf: `sudo sh -c 'echo "fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 62800" > /etc/sysctl.d/99-zceos.conf'`

Check the limit: `sudo sysctl -a  | grep -i inotify`

Mount the custom 99-zceos.conf to your cEOS-lab containers in the topology file:

```yaml
topology:
  kinds:
    ceos:
      binds:
        - /etc/sysctl.d/99-zceos.conf:/etc/sysctl.d/99-zceos.conf:ro
```

Add `--max-workers` and `--timeout` flags to your containerlab deploy command.

> NOTE: as of 4.28 default cEOS-lab 99-zceos.conf was updated and configures fs.inotify.max_user_instances to 62800. It is recommended to use cEOS-lab 4.28 or higher and Ubuntu 20LTS or higher. Nevertheless, always test your lab environment first, check inotify limits and set `--max-workers` and `--timeout` flags for a high scale deployment.  
> GOOD TO KNOW: inotify is also the main reason why cEOS-lab will not work on M1 Mac.
