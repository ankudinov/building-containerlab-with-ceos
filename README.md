This repository is a step-by-step guide explaining how to build a lab environment with [Containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/) and Arista cEOS-lab. It is only focusing on essential and cEOS-lab specific features and is not replacing the official [Containerlab documentation](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/). Please also check [Containerlab Github repository](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab) for the latest updates and features.

> Appreciation to [Roman Dodin](https://netdevops.me/) and [other cLab contributors](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/graphs/contributors) for making the world a better place!
